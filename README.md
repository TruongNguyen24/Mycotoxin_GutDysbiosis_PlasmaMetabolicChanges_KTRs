## Description

#### Gut_microbiome_analysis.R
- Code for gut microbiome analysis: alpha diversity, beta diversity
  
#### Compare_mycotoxin_concentration_CasevsControl.R
- Two sided wilcoxon test and Violine plot for mycotoxin concentration comparison (Fig.1)

#### Bayesian_Multinomial_Logistic_Normal_Models_Pibble.R
- Run Pibble model (Logistic-Normal model), computing differential abundances of taxa between mycotoxin exposed and unexposed KTRs

#### Plot_Pibble_differentially_abundant_taxa.R
- Function for visualizing the list of differentially abundant taxa and metabolites at 95% BCL between mycotoxin exposed and unexposed KTRs (Fig.3 and Supplementary Fig.2)

#### Computing_balance_value.R
- Function for computing balance (type of log ratio) between significant taxa (at 95% BCL) in exposed and unexposed groups

#### Predictive_performance_of_balances.R
- Function to examine the performance of balance to predict the exposure of mycotoxins

#### Joint_modelling_of_multiOmics_with_Orthus.R
- Function to integrate metageomics and metabolomics data using Orthus model

#### Network_analysis.R
- Function to build network of plasma metabolite and gut microbial species interaction (Fig.6)

#### Computing_balances_between_pairewise_modules.R
- Function to compute balances (type of log ratio) representing all pairwise combinations (M1-M2, M1-M3, M1-M4, M2-M3, M2-M4, M4-M3)

#### Survival_analysis.R
- Code for the survival analysis, including plotting Kaplan Meier curves
